<h2 id="anti">What is Antivirus</h2>
<video src="antivirus infomative.mp4" width="500px" controls preload="auto" muted type="video/mp4"></video>
    <p>The role of antivirus softwre is to prevent, detect and remove viruses and other types of malware from computers</p>
    <p>It helps to defend against threats like: </p>
    <h3>Threats</h3>
     <ol id="threatlist">
      <li>Malware</li>
      <p>It performs unwanted activities and changes in your system. examples include deleting files, slowing or crashing your system</p>
      <li>Spyware</li>
      <p>It is a software that hides in the operating system and can spy on your online activities.</p>
      <li>Viruses</li>
      <p>They are unwanted software that enter the system and make unwanted changes without the user's permissions</p>

    </ol>

<br>
<h3 id="antifunc">Functions</h3>
<p>Antivirus softwares have many useful functions that help to combat potential threats from invading your computer. It works by running as a background process. Many antivirus software programs exist with their own advantages and disadvantages but the main functions are usually these two:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scanning</li>
    <p> Antivirus softwares are able to scan specific files, directories or the system itself for any signs of potential malware. Users are able to schedule these scans at a certain time of their choosing. This is usually used as malware detection and real-time protection against viruses and other harmful threats. There are 4 different methods that are commonly used to scan;  </p>
    <dl>On-Demand Scan</dl>
    <p>As the name suggests, this scan occurs when the user manually asks the system to scan for malware either on the spot or on a scheduled time. It searches the content of disks, directories, files, boot sectors and system components. </p>
    <dl>Real-Time Protection</dl>
    <p>This is an automatic protection that keeps running in the background. As a result, the antivirus can catch the malware before the malware does any damage. It scans the system whenever a new program or device is freshly loaded in the memory. For example, downloading a new application. </p>
    <dl>Smart Scans</dl>
    <p>Using this, the software scans for file that are more suspicious of catching the malware</p>
    <li>Detection Methods</li>
    <p>Besides scanning, being able to detect the viruses are also just as important for viruses to be caught and removed. There are several ways of doing so and they are as follows:</p>
    <dl>Signature-Based Detection</dl>
    <p>In antivirus software, they have databases that have known virus signatures that amount to nearly 100,000. Although it is the best detection method for past viruses, it struggles against unknown or new viruses.  </p>
    <dl>Heuristic Detection</dl>
    <p>In this detection method, the antivirus uses an algorithm to examine file behavior and code structure for suspicious patterns that resemble known malware, helping to identify new viruses in the process  </p>
    <dl>Behavior-Based Detection</dl>
    <p>If the virus is successful in hiding from the above detection techniques, the antivirus checks the behavior of the programs to detect any malicious activities. This can be useful for dealing with malware that tries to steal information or alter certain settings from the computer system </p>
    <dl>Sandbox Detection</dl>
    <p>For this method, when there is any suspicious program, it is run in an artificial virtual environment to observe the behavoir of suspicious files before allowing execution on the actual system.</p>
    <li>Removal of Malware Software</li>
    <p>If it detects any malware software it removes it from the system. Some antivirus software does it by itself in the background while others require permission or inform the user before proceeding. If it finds any harm or unwanted activity it warns the user. Otherwise, it allows the software to run in the real environment.</p>

<h3 id="fireinfo"> What is Firewall</h3>
<video src="firewallintrovid.mp4" width="500px" controls preload="auto" muted type="video/mp4"></video>
<p>Firewall is essentially a security barrier that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic to prevent unauthorized access. It's role is to protect your computer or network from unwanted traffic. Without a firewall, most computers will be more prone to viruses and cyber attacks. It does this by prevented unautorized access from hackers trying to use viruses, backdoors and other types of attacks to infiltrate your computer. Additionally, firewalls also manage your network resources such as WiFi and usage of VPN. </p>
